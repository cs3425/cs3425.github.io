# Gods Dogs

## Welcome
I am a big dog and my name is Luna. I like the outdoors, small kids, eating other people's food, and not staying still for pictures.

I have 3 little brothers and one big sister. The brothers sometimes yell in my face but the joke is on them -- they are so small, I just eat the food right out of their hands. I have no regrets. 


I'm a blessing to this world because in addition to eating food out of tiny humans hands, I eat food off the kitchen counter and floor and have been affectionately nicknamed "the vaccuum". 


All jokes aside, vaccuums scare the crap out of me.
